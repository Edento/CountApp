# CountApp

This is a simple application I was working on to improve my React & Mongo skills.

It is made in order to track how many people entered to a place in a day (like guards have when you go to a night club).

<b>How to use:</b> 
* to increase the number of people, click the first button.
* to download a CSV file with the date&time stamps, click 'Download'
* to reset the list (for example, after downloading the file) click 'Reset'.  <B> Note: this cannot be undone. </B>
